### Analyzing Baby Names

Clearly for males or females (no gender-ambiguous names)

“Trending” but not “trendy”, i.e., on the upslope but not super-popular today. Maybe very popular in 10-20 years.

Cannot be easily (and commonly) shortened to a nickname (like “Benjamin” to “Ben”)

### Individual Name Popularity

#### Brian

#### Charles

#### Clint
